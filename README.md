# React + Vite

My React App is a web application built with Vite, using React and Redux for state management, and Firebase for user authentication. The app includes user authentication and routing with React Router.

To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies using npm install. Set up Firebase and configure your .env file with your Firebase credentials. You can run the app locally by starting the development server with npm run dev.

Make sure to install the Firebase SDK with npm install firebase and initialize it in src/firebase.js. The Login component manages user authentication through Firebase.
